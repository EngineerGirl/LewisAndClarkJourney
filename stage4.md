## North Americans in the Region:

## Noteworthy occurrences/Quotes:
When Lewis encountered the Native Americans, he believed that their fear and awe of bears was due to their inferior weapons. However, after the members of the expedition encountered a bear themselves, and shooting it at least ten times, with the bear showing no sign of injury, he realized that their fear and awe was well-founded.

## Travel/Clothing/Food/Supplies:
While traveling, some issues that they faced were with wayfinding, and traveling without the river. They had issues with wayfinding. Travel grew increasingly difficult, and the river split into three branches. They traveled down the branch that headed south, present-day Beaverhead River. The river also got shallower. They could not travel in boats, because they would run aground. In order to travel over land, however, they needed horses, so they had to barter with Native American tribes.
