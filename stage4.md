## Geography:
This region contained a variety of animals, such as coyotes, bighorn sheep, woodpeckers mountain quail, antelope, rattlesnake, and others. This region was mainly flat plains.
## North Americans in the Region:
One Native American tribe in the region was the Northern Plains Indians. (Elaborate on interactions and whatnot)
## Noteworthy occurrences/Quotes:
When Lewis encountered the Native Americans, he believed that their fear and awe of bears was due to their inferior weapons. However, after encountering a bear themselves, and shooting it multiple times to no avail, he realized that their fear and awe was well-founded.
## Travel/Clothing/Food/Supplies:
While traveling, some issues that they faced were with wayfinding, and traveling without the river. They had issues with wayfinding (elaborate elaborate). They also had issues with the river, because as it was summer, the river got shallower. They could not travel in boats, because they would run aground. In order to travel over land, however, they needed horses, so they had to barter with Native American tribes.
