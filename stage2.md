# Journey Up the Missouri River
## Geography in the region:
- The Missouri River
- many streams branch off of the river
- Plains, farmland, burning coal beds, and sandbars
- Pronghorn Antelope, mule deer, coyotes, prarie dogs, and horses
## Native Americans in the region (relations, trade, interactions, etc.):
When visiting the Sioux, Lewis attempted to give them gifts but they were seen as stingy. In turn, the Sioux reacted with anger and the Americans tried to undermine the Native American tribe structure. Later during an adoptive ritual, the two groups misunderstood each other again. It was a very eventful time and not in the best way.
## Noteworthy Occurrences (with Sioux Indians, etc.):
- "In all your intercourse with the natives, treat them in the most friendly and conciliatory manner which their own conduct will admit.": Thomas Jefferson's instruction to Lewis
- "to make a friendly impression" on the Sioux, "because of their immense power.": Jefferson's warning to the explores.
- "This immense river... waters one of the fairest portions of the globe, nor do I believe that there is in the universe a similar extent of country, equally fertile, well watered, and intersected by such a number of navigable streams.": Lewis describing the Great Plains.
- "Capt. Lewis & Capt Clark...Gave the 3 chiefs 3 niew meddals & 1 american flag Some knives & other Small articles of Goods.... they did not appear to talk much untill they had got the goods, and then they wanted more, and Said we must Stop with them or leave one of the pearogues with them." : John Ordway wrote in his journal.
