# Welcome to Stage 2!


# Journey Up the Missouri River
## Geography in the region:
- The Missouri River
- many streams branch off of the river
- Plains, farmland, burning coal beds, and sandbars
- Pronghorn Antelope, mule deer, coyotes, prarie dogs, and horses
## Native Americans in the region (relations, trade, interactions, etc.):
When visiting the Sioux, Lewis attempted to give them gifts but they were seen as stingy. In turn, the Sioux reacted with anger and the Americans tried to undermine the Native American tribe structure. Later during an adoptive ritual, the two groups misunderstood each other again. It was a very eventful time and not in the best way.
## Noteworthy Occurrences (with Sioux Indians, etc.):
- "In all your intercourse with the natives, treat them in the most friendly and conciliatory manner which their own conduct will admit.": Thomas Jefferson's instruction to Lewis
