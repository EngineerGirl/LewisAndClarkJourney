## Meriwether Lewis
Meriwether Lewis was born on August 18, 1774. In 1794 he joined the army, and in 1801 was appointed as Thomas Jefferson's secretary. In 1803, Thomas Jefferson asked him to lead an expedition to explore the Louisiana Territory. He agreed, and picked William Clark, a man he knew from the army, as a co-leader. In 1804, the expedition, a team of roughly 40 men, set off. It took them two years to navigate the Lousiana Territory, and the expedition ended in 1806. However, after the expedition completed, Thomas Jefferson appointed Lewis governor of the Lousiana Territory, which turned out to be a mistake, as Lewis was an introvert. By 1809, when he was summoned to Congress to account for his expenses, he was depressed, an alcoholic, and addicted to laudanum. Three years after the expedition completed, he committed suicide.

## William Clark
William Clark was born in Virginia on August 1, 1770. He was a soldier and explorer for the U.S. In the 1800s, Meriwether Lewis invited him to share command of an expedition appointed by Thomas Jefferson himself. The group of men exploring were The Corps of Discovery. Clark's Job was to take down the animal and plant species as well as the geography of the land west of the Mississippi River.
