# Reaching the Pacific Through the Columbia River
## Geography:
- Cascade Mountains
- Columbia River
- Pacific Ocean

## Native Americans in the Region:
The two groups saw trading and wealth very differently. One culture, Americans, focused on acumulation of wealth, while the other culture, Native Americans, gained status by giving wealth away.
Lewis and Clark developed a bad reputation with Native Americans because of the differences in the way they traded.

The Corps of Discovery posed a threat to the Wishram, because the arrival of the Americans threatened their trade monopoly. The Native Americans and Americans had very different ideas about value, and what types of items were valuable. Many items prized by the Chinookans were based on their class system. The Americans ridiculed them for wanting these things, while they nearly traded everything they had for a few otter pelts.
Both groups had a very different idea of trade. With the Native Americans, trade was about building a good relationship with trading partners, while for the Americans, it was just done for the sake of trade. This caused a lot of misunderstanding between them when it came to trade.


## Noteworthy Occurences:
Lewis treated the Clatsop tribe very differently from the Shoshone. While with the Shoshone there had been an air of cultural openness, with the Clatsops, there was an air of almost revulsion.

When Clark first met the Chinook, he said, "I told those Indians . . . that they Should not Come near us, and if one of their nation Stold anything from us, I would have him Shot . . .". This also expresses Lewis's sentiment of revulsion towards the Native Americans.

## Travel/Clothing/Food/Supplies:
When they reached the place where the Columbia River meets the Cascade Mountains, the expedition met with dark, rainy weather. This was repeated all winter.
The expedition members anticipated finding a fort near the Pacific Ocean, but when they got there, all they saw were waves breaking against the shore.
