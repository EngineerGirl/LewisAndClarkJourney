# Preparation
## Preparing for the expedition:
To prepare for the expedition, Lewis took a crash corse in the scientific skills of an Enlightenment explorer. He visited the "intellectuals of Philedelphia" who then gave him advice and questions. Robert Patterson gave Lewis an astronomy notebook while Benjamin Rush provided advice on staying healthy in the wilderness. Lewis brought a ton of books on geography, botany, astronamy, math, mineralogy, and encyclopedias. Under the assumption that the trip would be a small one, he only brought enough clothing and weapons for a dozen men and figured that they would rely on hunting for food. However, this does not mean Lewis packed light. Along with the other supplies, tons of Native American presents were loaded onto the ship and his men were fully armed and trained enough to intimidate any nation that might oppose the U.S. 
## Final Preparation:
The expedition took a tun and grew to four times larger than what Jefferson has originally planned: 48 men with supplies for each one. The Louisiana Purchase benefitted the U.S. and also made them a representative of foreign power. When the Napoleon sold the Louisiana Territory to the U.S. Jefferson told the two exlorers that they would have to go through all the nations on the area. The French people in the territory must know that they are now under U.S. rule but it should be done peacefully. This means that the U.S. told the people that the U.S, is now their father but also their friends.
