# Welcome to Stage 5!


# Through the Rocky Mountains
## Geography:
- Plains
- Continental Divide
- River
## Native Americans in the Region:
When communicating with Native Americans, everything depended on cultural assumptions. This made communication very difficult, as well as the fact that any comunication had to pass through a network of people, a language chain.

## Noteworthy Occurrences:
Lewis and Clark carried vocabulary lists so they could transcribe the Native American language. However, the Native Americans misinterpreted their intent. They thought that it was part of some evil plot against them. Only the unused vocabulary sheets survived the expedition.
When Cameawait and Lewis exchanged clothing, it was a powerful act. One's clothing was part of oneself.

## Travel/Clothing/Food/Supplies:
Their clothing was uniform, but had slight nuances that differentiated and established the chain of command. Their clothing was designed to show their unity.
