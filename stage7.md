# Returning Home

## Noteworthy Occurences of the Journey Home:
The members planned to return home in three groups, Lewis's group, John Ordway's group, and Clarks's group.
When the members of the expedition encountered the Chinookan tribes, they didn't have enough items left to pay the tribes for their passage back, and end up having to fight to make their way home. However, while Lewis reacted in a inflammatory way to agression from the Native Americans, Clark used trickery to cause the Native Americans to fear him. When the Cascade tribe stole Lewis's dog, he reacted with rage, saying that he would "put them to instant death". Clark, however, played on the Native Americans' beliefs to scare them.

## Accomplishments:
Thomas Jefferson appointed Lewis governor of the Louisiana Territory, and Clark brigadier general of the territory's militia and superintendent of Indian affairs. The US started to become united, and started to develop a culture. Lewis and Clark were deeply knit into the national image, as they had helped create it.
