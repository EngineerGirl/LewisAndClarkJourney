# Returning Home

## Noteworthy Occurences of the Journey Home:
When the members of the expedition encountered the Chinookan tribes, they didn't have enough items left to pay the tribes for their passage back, and end up having to fight to make their way home. However, while Lewis reacted in a inflammatory way to agression from the Native Americans, Clark used trickery to cause the Native Americans to fear him. When the Cascade tribe stole Lewis's dog, he reacted with rage, saying that he would "put them to instant death". Clark, however, played on the Native Americans' beliefs to scare them.
