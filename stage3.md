## Native American maps v. European Maps:
- European maps are based on precise measurement and calculations, as well as latitude & longitude. 
- European maps were meant to show what the surrounding area looks like. 
- Native American maps were diagrams of human landscape interactions. This means that the maps were drawn to show a journey/battle or a mythic act of some sort. 
- They map routes, not rivers. Rivers were instead diagrammatical not representational.
- The size of a map feature showed its importance not actual size and the view point is from the land scape. 
- Any distances meant travel time.

## Lewis & Clark's cartography techniques:
- Celestial navigation: finding location based on latitude and longitude. This was in relation to the sun, moon, or stars calculated with an octant or sextant.
- Dead Reckoning: They kept track of factors such as direction changes and how far they traveled as well as the speed of the boat.

## Native Americans & Sacagawea:
- Some tribes held women in higher status then others.
- Women actually had a good amount of economic power.
- Native American women had control of their children and owned anything they made. (this includes crafts and money)
- Sacagawea adopted her sister's son and had two brothers. She was compassionate and kind while helping Lewis & Clark

## Noteworthy occurrences:
- The meeting of Sacagawea.
- The men built a fort and stayed by the vilages to wait out the winter.
